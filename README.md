## Overview

I've decided to study the fullstack roadmap from the bottom up. For this challenge, I'm focusing solely on HTML and CSS. My main goals were practicing nesting and using CSS variables, while also applying a mobile-first workflow.

It was a relatively easy challenge, but completing it felt great. I'm looking forward to the next one!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I will be improving this challange code using SCSS or SASS and, in the future, try to create a VueJS example using the concept of components.
